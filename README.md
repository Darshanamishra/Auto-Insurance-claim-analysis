Auto Insurance Claims Analysis

In this project, I analyzed auto insurance claims data using Excel pivot tables, Power Query, and various data visualization techniques. The goal of the project was to help insurance companies better understand risk factors, claim trends, and customer behavior, leading to more informed decision-making processes.

Key deliverables included a dynamic, interactive dashboard that provided insights on claims across different periods and geographic regions. The dashboard allowed users to filter data based on multiple criteria such as claim type, policy period, and customer demographics, enabling more tailored strategies for risk mitigation and customer service optimization.

Throughout this project, I have demonstrated my deep understanding and practical knowledge in the following areas:


1. Data Transformation Techniques
2. Pivot Table
3. Power Query
4. Dax Measures
5. Conditional Formatting
6. Risk Factors Metrics
7. Intrective Dashboard for end user
   
The insights derived from the analysis helped the insurance company improve operational efficiency, reduce fraud, and maximize profitability by identifying high-risk areas and optimizing resource allocation.
