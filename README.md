In this project, I analyzed auto insurance claims data using Excel pivot tables, Power Query, and various data visualization techniques. The project aimed to help insurance companies better understand risk factors, claim trends, and customer behavior, leading to more informed decision-making processes.

- A dynamic, interactive dashboard that provided insights on claims across different periods and geographic regions.
- Users can filter data based on multiple criteria such as claim type, policy period, and customer demographics, enabling more tailored strategies for risk mitigation and customer service optimization.

## Skills Demonstrated

Throughout this project, I have demonstrated my deep understanding and practical knowledge in the following areas:

- Data Transformation Techniques
- Pivot Tables
- Power Query
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Conditional Formatting
